# Blog created from the Aria Template

I created this blog from an [Astro](https://astro.build) template which is an Astro port of [aria](https://github.com/static-templates/aria).

You can install this theme with the [Astro](https://astro.build) command like so:

```js

npm create astro@latest -- --template ccbikai/astro-aria

```
